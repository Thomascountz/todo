# Milk. Eggs. Flour.
jQuery and CSS Flexbox Project to explore simple fontend development

## What's inside?
Another todo list for the web. State is maintained by using `localStorage`. I extracted the `save();` function in hopes that I could easily utilize this with a (Rails) backend by writing a function that makes an API request. I also experimented with CSS Flexbox for the first time, which easily allowed me to create a pseudo-responsive design. This project only scratched the surface of frontend development, but allowed me to refamiliarize myself with Javascript concepts!
